# High-Volume Spintax Examples

Knowledge base of approved high-volume spintax patterns that pass both spam and grammar checks.

**Key principle:** Every example below is ANCHORED to a control message. Spintax = variations OF the control, not rewrites.

---

## Control Anchoring (REQUIRED)

Before creating ANY spintax, establish the control message:

```text
CONTROL:
We take what's already working on your LinkedIn and distribute it on Reddit
so ChatGPT starts mentioning your brand within 4 to 6 weeks.
Would you give me feedback on a Reddit audit if I put one together?
```

**Anchoring rules:**

| Rule | Bad | Good |
|------|-----|------|
| Structure match | Changing sentence order | Keep original structure |
| True synonyms only | "building" for "growing" | "expanding" for "growing" |
| Preposition consistency | "analysis of" + "look at" | All use "of" OR all use "at" |
| Only replace spam words | Rewriting whole phrases | Replace "marketing" → "presence" |

**Less spintax that maintains quality > more spintax that drifts.**

## Example 1: LaunchClub Founder-Led Content

### Core Elements (MUST preserve)
- **Offer Flow:** LinkedIn content -> Reddit distribution -> AI/LLM mentions
- **CTA Type:** Audit-based ask (review/feedback on deliverable)

### Variation Count
- **Sentence 1:** 8 blocks x 4 options = 4^8 = 65,536 variations
- **Sentence 2:** 3 blocks x 4 options = 4^3 = 64 variations
- **Total:** 65,536 x 64 = **4,194,304 variations** (4M+)

### Final Approved Copy

```
{We take|We repurpose|We leverage|We use} {what's already working on your LinkedIn|your best-performing LinkedIn content|what's resonating on your LinkedIn|your top LinkedIn content} and {distribute it|get it out|spread it|push it} {to the right places|strategically|where it matters|to key spots} on Reddit so {ChatGPT|AI|LLMs|AI search} {starts mentioning|begins citing|starts referencing|picks up on} your brand {within 4 to 6 weeks|in 4-6 weeks|within a month or so|in about a month}.

{Would you give me feedback on|Would you be open to reviewing|Would you mind looking at|Could I get your thoughts on} {a Reddit audit|a quick Reddit audit|an audit|a Reddit analysis} {if I put one together|if I prepare one|if I create one|if I draft one up}?

```

**Key design choice:** The source block combines "your" + "LinkedIn" in each option to ensure the offer flow always references THEIR LinkedIn content explicitly.

### Block Breakdown

| Block | Phrase | Options |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Verb | We take, We repurpose, We leverage, We use |
| 2 | Source (your LinkedIn) | what's already working on your LinkedIn, your best-performing LinkedIn content, what's resonating on your LinkedIn, your top LinkedIn content |
| 3 | Action | distribute it, get it out, spread it, push it |
| 4 | Target | to the right places, strategically, where it matters, to key spots |
| 5 | AI reference | ChatGPT, AI, LLMs, AI search |
| 6 | Outcome verb | starts mentioning, begins citing, starts referencing, picks up on |
| 7 | Timeline | within 4 to 6 weeks, in 4-6 weeks, within a month or so, in about a month |
| 8 | CTA opening | Would you give me feedback on, Would you be open to reviewing, Would you mind looking at, Could I get your thoughts on |
| 9 | Deliverable | a Reddit audit, a quick Reddit audit, an audit, a Reddit analysis |
| 10 | Condition | if I put one together, if I prepare one, if I create one, if I draft one up |

### Grammar Pitfalls Avoided

| Issue | Bad | Good |
|-------|-----|------|
| Plural subject + singular verb | "AI tools starts" | "AI search starts" or "LLMs start" |
| Pronoun mismatch | "your top posts... distribute it" | "your top content... distribute it" |
| Breaking offer flow | "on your feed" (no LinkedIn) | "on your LinkedIn" (explicit) |
| Verb + infinitive mismatch | "We {help\|support} you grow" | "We {help\|support} you to grow" OR only use "help" |

**Verb + Infinitive Rule:**
- "help" works with bare infinitive: "We help you grow" ✓
- "support/work with/partner with/assist" require "to": "We support you to grow" ✓
- BROKEN: "We support you grow" ✗

**Fix options:**
1. Use only verbs that work the same way: `{help|assist|enable|empower}` (all work without "to")
2. Add "to" for all: `We {help|support|work with} teams to {grow|scale|expand}`

### Spam Words Avoided

| Original | Flagged As | Replacement |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| "take a look at" | Spam phrase | "give me feedback on" |
| "opportunity" | Spam word | "audit" or "analysis" |
| "for you" | Spam phrase | Removed or rephrased |

---

## Example 2: LaunchClub Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Why Hybrid?

Combines word-level and phrase-level spintax for maximum variations with grammar safety.

| Level | Use For | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Word-level | Verbs, adjectives, simple adverbs | `{take|repurpose|leverage|use}` |
| Phrase-level | Complex structures, bound phrases | `{your best content|what's working}` |

### Variation Count

- **Sentence 1:** 4x4x4x4x4x2x4x2x4 = 131,072
- **Sentence 2:** 2x4x4x4 = 128
- **Total:** 131,072 x 128 = **16,777,216 variations** (16M+)

### Final Approved Copy

```text
We {take|repurpose|leverage|use} {what's already working|what's currently performing|your best content|your top content} on your LinkedIn and {distribute|spread|push|get} it {to the right places|strategically|where it matters|to key spots} on Reddit so {ChatGPT|AI|LLMs|AI search} {starts|begins} {mentioning|citing|referencing|picking up on} your brand {within|in} {4 to 6 weeks|4-6 weeks|about a month|a month or so}.

{Would you|Could you} {give me feedback on|be open to reviewing|mind looking at|share your thoughts on} {a Reddit audit|a quick audit|a Reddit analysis|an audit} if I {put one together|prepare one|create one|draft one up}?

Ken Savage - Founder of Launch Club
```

### Block Breakdown

| # | Type | Block | Options |
|---|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Word | Verb | take, repurpose, leverage, use |
| 2 | Phrase | Source | what's already working, what's currently performing, your best content, your top content |
| 3 | Word | Action | distribute, spread, push, get |
| 4 | Phrase | Target | to the right places, strategically, where it matters, to key spots |
| 5 | Word | AI ref | ChatGPT, AI, LLMs, AI search |

| 7 | Word | Outcome | mentioning, citing, referencing, picking up on |
| 8 | Word | Preposition | within, in |
| 9 | Phrase | Timeline | 4 to 6 weeks, 4-6 weeks, about a month, a month or so |
| 10 | Word | CTA start | Would you, Could you |
| 11 | Phrase | CTA ask | give me feedback on, be open to reviewing, mind looking at, share your thoughts on |
| 12 | Phrase | Deliverable | a Reddit audit, a quick audit, a Reddit analysis, an audit |
| 13 | Phrase | Condition | put one together, prepare one, create one, draft one up |

## Design Principles

### 0. Control Anchoring (Most Important)

Every spintax must be anchored to the original control message. See top of this document.

### 1. False Synonym Avoidance

Not all "similar" words are interchangeable:

| Word | NOT a synonym for | Why |
|------|-------------------|-----|
| building | growing | Building = creating from scratch, growing = expanding existing |
| look at | analysis of | Different preposition patterns, different formality |
| check out | review | Different tone, "check out" more casual |
| tons | hundreds | "tons" is informal, changes tone |

**Rule:** If unsure, check against control. Does the replacement change meaning or tone?

### 2. Subject-Verb Agreement

When using AI tool synonyms, keep subjects grammatically consistent:

- **Singular subjects:** ChatGPT, AI, AI search -> use "starts", "begins", "picks up"
- **Plural subjects:** LLMs, AI tools -> use "start", "begin", "pick up"

**Solution:** Either use only singular OR only plural subjects, not mixed.

### 3. Pronoun Consistency

When referencing content, keep noun number consistent:

- **Singular:** "what's working", "your content", "top content" -> "it"
- **Plural:** "your posts", "your articles" -> "them"

**Solution:** Use all singular source references to match "distribute **it**"

### 4. Offer Flow Preservation

The grammar checker validates MESSAGE-LEVEL drift, not word-level:

- OK: ChatGPT -> LLMs -> AI -> AI search (semantic equivalents)
- OK: 4-6 weeks -> about a month (same timeline)
- NOT OK: LinkedIn -> "your feed" (ambiguous, could be other platforms)
- NOT OK: Audit CTA -> Call/demo CTA (different CTA type)

### 5. Target Variation Count

- **Minimum:** 4^8 = 65,536 variations
- **Ideal:** 4^10 or higher = 1M+ variations
- **This example:** 4^11 = 4,194,304 variations

**BUT:** Quality > quantity. 64 clean variations beat 1M broken ones.
