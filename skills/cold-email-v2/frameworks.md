## Framework #1: WYWYN (Why You, Why Now)

**When to use:** Demand generation offers where you need to create urgency.

**Structure:**
- **Why You:** Explain why you're reaching out to them specifically
- **Why Now:** Create urgency around timing or opportunity

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed you oversee growth at {{company}} - we've heard from other B2B sales leaders that Q4 can be feast or famine depending on lead flow.

We partner with similar B2B service providers to book them 8-20 meetings every month on a performance basis.

Recently Comma Copywriters netted $150k in revenue through our outbound prospecting efforts - a 10X ROI.

Mind if I send over the customer testimonial?

Best,
Nick
```

**Why it works:** Creates relevance through research and urgency through timing.

---

## Framework #2: Poke The Bear (Josh Braun Method)

**When to use:** When you want to agitate a known pain point your ICP faces.

**Structure:**
- Lead with a challenging question
- Offer your solution
- Soft CTA for value

**Example:**
```
{{firstName}} - are you dealing with inconsistent lead flow that's making it impossible to forecast revenue?

If so, we help B2B agencies book 10-20 qualified meetings per month on autopilot.

Mind if I share more on how this works?

Let me know,
```

**Why it works:** Agitates existing pain and positions solution as relief.

---

## Framework #3: The 4 P's (Problem, Promise, Proof, Proposal)

**When to use:** Demand capture when prospects already know they have the problem.

**Structure:**
- **Problem:** Call out their specific challenge
- **Promise:** What you'll help them achieve
- **Proof:** Quick case study or result
- **Proposal:** Clear next step

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Most marketing agencies struggle with unpredictable lead flow - feast or famine cycles that make growth planning impossible.

We help agencies generate 15-25 qualified meetings per month, creating predictable revenue streams.

Just helped Digital Design Media increase their pipeline by 300% in 6 weeks using our outbound system.

Are you available for a 15-minute call this Thursday to discuss how we could do the same for {{company}}?

Best,
Nick
```

**Why it works:** Logical structure that mirrors how buyers think.

---

## Framework #4: AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)

**When to use:** Classic framework that works well for most B2B services.

**Structure:**
- **Attention:** Hook in 1 line - pain, trigger, or change. Something real.
- **Interest:** Earn trust, fast - speak to 1 pain. Show you get it.
- **Desire:** Back it up - Real results. Real company.
- **Action:** Make next step frictionless. No hard CTA. Just an interest check.

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}}, too many no-show demos this week?

Built a tool that slashes ramp time for SDRs - so they book higher-intent meetings, not just more of them.

Teams like {{company_name}} use it to cut demo no-shows by 37% in under 30 days.

Want to see how it fits your team?

Best,
Troy
```

**Why it works:** Time-tested structure that guides prospects through logical decision-making.

---

## Framework #5: CBC (Context, Benefit, CTA)

**When to use:** When you have strong context about their situation and a clear benefit.

**Structure:**
- **Context:** Relevant situation or trigger event
- **Benefit:** What you can help them achieve
- **CTA:** Simple next step

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

I saw {{company}} is expanding into the European market based on your recent LinkedIn post.

We help SaaS companies entering new markets generate qualified leads from day one, typically booking 10-15 meetings in the first month.

Would you be interested in seeing how we helped similar companies accelerate their international expansion?

Best,
Nick
```

**Why it works:** Highly relevant context makes the benefit feel immediately applicable.

---

## Framework #6: The SPARK Method

**When to use:** Perfect for highly researched, personalized outreach.

**Structure:**
- **S**pecific trigger (happening at their company now)
- **P**roblem awareness (challenge this creates)
- **A**uthority proof (1-line case study)
- **R**elevant outcome (what's possible for them)
- **K**indling question (soft CTA offering value)

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company}} just announced your Series B and plans to double headcount in Q1.

Rapid scaling often creates challenges with lead generation - most companies struggle to maintain pipeline velocity while building their sales team.

We just helped ProductEVO navigate similar growth, adding $90k in profit during their expansion phase.

With the right system, you could have 25+ qualified meetings booked monthly while your new hires focus on closing instead of prospecting.

Would you be interested in seeing the exact playbook we used?

Best,
Troy
```

**Why it works:** Combines timely relevance with social proof and a compelling outcome.

---

## Framework #7: Pain Amplification → Dream State

**When to use:** Most effective for demand generation offers where you need to create problem awareness.

**Structure:**
- **Pain:** Current frustration
- **Amplify:** Cost of inaction
- **Dream:** Life after working with you
- **Bridge:** Your solution as the path

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

Are you tired of your sales team spending more time prospecting than actually selling?

Every hour they spend building lists and sending cold emails is an hour they're not closing deals. At your current close rate, that's potentially $50k+ in lost revenue per rep, per month.

Imagine your team waking up to 5-7 pre-qualified meetings already on their calendar, with prospects who've already been educated about your solution and are ready to buy.

We've built a system that does exactly this - generating 15-25 qualified meetings monthly so your reps can focus purely on closing.

Curious how this would impact your revenue?

Best,
Troy
```

**Why it works:** Creates emotional urgency by amplifying pain before showing the solution.

---

## Framework #8: The Authority Opener

**When to use:** When you have strong case studies and want to lead with credibility.

**Structure:**
- Lead with impressive result
- Explain how you achieved it
- Connect to their situation
- Offer similar outcome

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

$500,000 in 6 months.

That's what Bill from Integrated Service Partners generated using our cold email system after struggling with inconsistent lead flow.

I noticed {{company}} offers similar B2B services, and with your reputation in the {{industry}} space, I'm confident we could achieve even better results.

Are you currently happy with your lead generation, or would you be interested in exploring how we helped Bill transform his business?

Best,
Nick
```

**Why it works:** Leading with a strong result immediately establishes credibility and creates curiosity.

---

## Framework #9: The Trojan Horse

**When to use:** Perfect for first touch when you want to provide value before asking for anything.

**Structure:**
- Offer something valuable for free
- Make it specific to them
- Use reciprocity to earn their time
- Follow up with your actual offer

**Example:**
```
Hi {{firstName}},

I put together a competitive analysis showing exactly which keywords your top 3 competitors are outranking you on.

Would you like me to send it over? It includes a breakdown of their content gaps and some quick wins you could implement this quarter.

No strings attached - just thought it might be valuable given your recent focus on SEO.

Best,
Troy

P.S. - If you find it helpful, I'd love to show you how we helped similar companies increase their organic traffic by 200%+ in 90 days.
```

**Why it works:** Provides immediate value, triggering reciprocity and building trust before making any ask.

## Framework #10: Hormozi Offer Formula

**When to use:** Raw copy tests, high-volume campaigns, or when you need maximum compression of value prop into one punchy sentence.

**Formula:** If we could {dream outcome} in {time delay} without {effort/sacrifice}, would you {CTA}?

**Rules:**
- 8th grade reading level
- Punchy, pain-first
- Max 3 variants per angle
- Use sensory "see feel touch" language

**Example:**
```
If we could stop your AI from hallucinating because your parser fed it garbage, in one API call, without rebuilding anything, worth discussing?
```

**Components:**

| Component | Examples |
|-----------|----------|
| **Dream Outcomes** | Stop AI hallucinations, 98% accuracy on messy docs, agent remembers everything after crash, ship today instead of Q2 |
| **Time Delays** | in one API call, in 30 seconds, in 60 seconds, today instead of Q2 |
| **Effort/Sacrifice** | without rebuilding anything, without Kubernetes or Terraform, without a DevOps hire, without 3-6 months of infrastructure |
| **CTAs** | worth discussing? worth a conversation? worth testing? worth discussing, or not really? |

**Why it works:** Compresses entire value prop into one sentence. Binary question at the end makes reply easy. "Without" clause removes objections preemptively.

---

## Framework #11: Binary Soft CTA

**When to use:** End of any cold email when you want to maximize reply rate while minimizing spam flags.

**Pattern:** "Worth discussing X, or not really?"

**Variations:**
- "Worth discussing how this compares to your current pipeline, or not really?"
- "Worth discussing if this applies to your workflow, or not really?"
- "Worth testing on your docs, or not really?"
- "Worth a conversation, or not really?"

**Why it works:**
- Binary choice reduces cognitive load (yes/no vs open-ended)
- "or not really?" gives easy out (reduces spam marking)
- Shows you're not desperate
- Can reply in 2 words

**Persona-specific CTAs:**
| Persona | CTA |
|---------|-----|
| Technical Founder | "Worth a conversation, or not really?" |
| Engineering Leader | "Worth discussing how this affects your roadmap, or not really?" |
| IC Engineer | "Worth testing on your workflows, or not really?" |
| Ops/Process Owner | "Worth discussing if this applies to your operations, or not really?" |

## Framework #12: The Mouse Trap

**When to use:** First touch, DM, or follow-up when you have a clear signal. Best for demand capture with high-intent signals.

**Structure:**
- **Observation:** Context for why you're in their inbox (1 sentence)
- **Question:** Value-prop driven, binary (yes/no answerable), implies your solution

**Rules:**
- Keep it 1-2 sentences total
- Question must be binary (answerable with yes or no)
- Don't explicitly state what you do - imply it
- Question implies you have the solution to a challenge

**Example:**
```
{{firstName}}, looks like you're hiring reps.

Would it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping up on email?
```

**Why it works:** Drives impulsive reply based on curiosity. It's a priority check - if what you mention is their priority, you get a quick response. Minimal investment to reply, maximum relevance.

---

## Framework #13: The Mouse Trap with Context

**When to use:** Same as Mouse Trap, but when prospect may need slightly more context to understand your value prop.

**Structure:**
- **Observation:** Context for why you're in their inbox (1 sentence)
- **Question:** Value-prop driven, binary
- **Context:** One line explaining how you help (implied solution to the challenge)

**Example:**
```
{{firstName}}, looks like you're hiring reps.

Would it be helpful to get a more granular look at how they're ramping on email? Our in-inbox email coach helps teams ramp faster.
```

**Why it works:** Takes the Mouse Trap and adds a bridge to understanding. Still short and direct - works as DM or bump too. The context line prevents "what do you mean?" replies.

---

## Pro Tips for Implementation

1. **Always Personalize the Hook:** Even with frameworks, the first line should reference something specific about them or their company.

2. **Keep It Conversational:** Write like you're talking to someone at a crowded bar - casual but professional.

3. **One CTA Per Email:** Don't confuse them with multiple asks. One clear next step.

4. **Test Multiple Frameworks:** What works for one audience might not work for another. Test 2-3 frameworks simultaneously.

5. **Use Spintax for Scale:** Vary your messaging to avoid spam filters when sending at volume.
