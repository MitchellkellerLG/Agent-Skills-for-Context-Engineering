## EmailBison Variable Format

When writing copy for EmailBison, use this snippet/variable format:

| Variable | Format | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| First name | `{FIRST_NAME}` | Hey {FIRST_NAME}, |
| Company | `{COMPANY}` | Noticed {COMPANY} just... |
| Signature | `{SENDER_EMAIL_SIGNATURE}` | (at end of email) |
| Custom snippets | `{SNIPPET_NAME}` | {HOOK}, {PL1}, {BODY} |

**Convention:**

## Format 1: Founder Card

Personal, story-based approach. Best for early-stage or building credibility.

**Structure:**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

We're building something for [persona] and I'd love your feedback.

The problem we're trying to solve: [Core Pain in 1-2 sentences].

We built [solution description]. [Proof point].

Worth a quick email back and forth?
```

**When to use:**

- Early stage companies
- Building credibility with new market
- Want market insight/feedback
- Softer ask, lower pressure

**Example (70 words):**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

We're building something for development teams and I'd love your feedback.

The problem we're trying to solve: by the time an opportunity shows up in standard databases, it's already crowded. Firms miss targets because they're 45 days late to the signal.

We built a system that tracks hiring patterns, leadership changes, and operational signals to surface targets before they hit the database. A major firm uses it across their entire team.

Worth a quick email back and forth?
```

## Format 2: Deliverable Hook

Lead with the deliverable. Best when you have a clear lead magnet.

**Structure:**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

[Observation about their situation].

[Deliverable Name]: [What it is] for [who it's for].

We identify [pain metric] and show you [specific insight].

Takes [time]. [Low-commitment next step].
```

**When to use:**

- Have a free audit, report, or analysis to offer
- Want to demonstrate value before asking for time
- Building a list of engaged prospects

**Example (62 words):**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

Noticed {COMPANY} just closed {RECENT_DEAL}.

When you're sourcing, how often do you find out about an opportunity after competitors have already reached out?

We built a system that tracks signals like hiring patterns and leadership changes to surface opportunities 45 days before they hit standard databases. A major firm uses it across their entire team.

Would that be helpful or not really?
```

## Format 3: Direct Offer

Clear, action-oriented. Best when confident in offer with strong proof.

**Structure:**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

[Specific outcome] in [timeframe].

We've done this for [proof point with metric].

[Clear next step - yes/no question].
```

**When to use:**

- Strong proof points
- Clear, simple offer
- Prospects who value directness
- Time-sensitive opportunities

**Example (45 words):**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

If you tell me your focus area, we'll run our system and send you 10 opportunities showing early signals. Targets your competitors won't find for another 45 days.

Our system is used by a major firm across their entire team.

Do you want it?
```

## Format 4: Outcome-First

Lead with the result. Best when you have strong case studies.

**Structure:**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

[Specific outcome with metrics].

That's what [similar company] achieved when [what we did].

For [target segment], we [offer description].

[Simple CTA].
```

**When to use:**

- Have impressive case study metrics
- Targeting similar companies to past wins
- Want to lead with proof, not pitch

**Example (52 words):**

```
Hey {FIRST_NAME},

Tell me your thesis. We'll deliver a list of 10 opportunities showing early signals. Hiring changes, new facilities, leadership moves.

These are targets 45 days away from hitting standard databases. Competitors won't see them yet. A major firm uses this across their entire team.

Do you want the list?
```
