# Follow-Up Email Sequences

## Philosophy

**All sequences are 2 emails only.** Diminishing returns after Email 2. Keep it tight.

- **Email 1:** Full campaign - best research, best angle, best CTA
- **Email 2:** Different value prop - they saw it but didn't reply, try another angle

**Key insight:** If they didn't reply to Email 1, that angle didn't resonate. Don't repeat it—rotate to a different value proposition.

## The "3 Offers" Framework

There are only 3 offers in the world:

1. **Save time** (efficiency, automation)
2. **Save money** (reduce costs, better ROI)
3. **Make money** (increase revenue, conversions)

**Email 1:** Lead with your strongest value prop
**Email 2:** Rotate to a different one

---

## Email 1: Full Campaign

**Timing:** Day 0
**Subject:** New subject line (2-4 words OR whole offer)
**Strategy:** Custom signal OR whole offer OR creative ideas

This is your best shot. Use:

- Strongest research signal
- Best case study
- Clearest value prop
- Most compelling CTA

**See examples.md for templates**

## Email 2: Rotate Value Prop (Threaded) - FINAL EMAIL

**Timing:** 3-4 days after Email 1
**Subject:** NONE (threads to Email 1 in SmartLead/Instantly)
**Strategy:** Different angle OR resources/redirect

### Option A: Rotate Value Prop

If Email 1 was "Save Time" → Email 2 should be "Make Money" or "Save Money"
If Email 1 was "Make Money" → Email 2 should be "Save Time" or show them HOW

## Email 2 Opener Bank (Casual Intros)

**All Email 2s must start with a casual opener.** Pick one:

| Opener | Tone |
|--------|------|
| "Oh totally forgot to mention {{first_name}}." | Casual, afterthought |
| "Oh forgot to say {{first_name}}." | Quick, informal |
| "Oh shoot wanted to mention {{first_name}}." | Slightly urgent |
| "Completely meant to say {{first_name}}." | Apologetic |

**Why casual openers work:**
- Feels like a real person who forgot something
- Not salesy or scripted
- Creates continuity with Email 1
- Low-pressure tone

**Do NOT start Email 2 with:**
- "{{first_name}}, quick follow-up." (too generic)
- "Just checking in..." (waste of words)
- "Bumping this to the top..." (annoying)
- Any em-dashes (—) in the opener

---

### Template 1: Quick Follow-Up + New Angle

**When to use:** Standard follow-up with rotated value prop

**Structure:**

```
Oh totally forgot to mention {{first_name}}.

[New value prop or angle in 1-2 sentences]

[Proof point or case study metric]

Still relevant?
```

**Example:**

```
Oh totally forgot to mention {{first_name}}.

The boards that pass testing but fail in the field? That's usually moisture absorbed before floor life even started.

We've helped similar manufacturers cut field returns by 30%+ with controlled environments.

Still relevant?
```

---

### Template 2: Creative Ideas (Visual Value)

**When to use:** You can generate credible, specific ideas

**Structure:**

```
Oh forgot to say {{first_name}}, had some ideas for you:

• Idea 1: [Specific action]
• Idea 2: [Specific action]
• Idea 3: [Specific action]

Wrote this without knowing your current priorities. If interesting, happy to share what's working in {{industry}}.
```

**Why it works:**

- Visual (bullets) = easy to scan
- Shows you did MORE research
- Acknowledges limits = invites conversation

---

### Template 3: Stats/Data Hook

**When to use:** You have interesting data about them

**Structure:**

```
Oh shoot wanted to mention {{first_name}}, my last email probably didn't show how we could help.

For example at {{company}}:
• [Data point 1]
• [Data point 2]
• [Data point 3]

Worth a quick look?
```

**Why it works:**

- Acknowledges Email 1 = humility
- SHOWS capability instead of telling
- Specific numbers = personalized

---

### Option B: Resource Offer (Low Commitment)

**When to use:** When you sense they're interested but busy, or as a soft close

**Structure:**

```
Completely meant to say {{first_name}}, if now's not the right time, totally understand.

Would it be useful if I sent over [specific resource that helps with their pain]?

Let me know.
```

**Why it works:**

- Acknowledges they're busy (empathy)
- Offers value without asking for time
- Ultra-low friction (just say yes)

---

### Option C: Redirect to Another Person

**When to use:** When you're not sure they're the right contact

**Structure:**

```
Oh totally forgot to mention {{first_name}}. Should I reach out to {{employee_1}} or {{employee_2}} about {{specific_problem}} instead?

Either way, appreciate the time.
```

**Why it works:**

- Shows you did research (named actual employees)
- Gives them an easy out (forward it)
- Polite close

## Sequence Summary Table

| Email | Timing | Subject | Strategy | Goal |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|------|
| 1 | Day 0 | New (2-4 words) | Custom signal OR whole offer | Earn reply/meeting |
| 2 | Day 3-4 | NONE (thread) | Rotate value prop OR resources/redirect | Different angle, soft close |

---

## Value Prop Rotation Examples

### Example 1: PCB/Electronics Manufacturing

**Email 1 (Prevent Failures):** "Are your boards passing bench tests but failing in the field?" → Focus on latent moisture damage

**Email 2 (Reduce Costs):** "Every rework attempt on dense boards risks destroying neighbors. We've helped cut field returns 30%+" → Focus on rework cost reduction

---

### Example 2: Outbound Automation Tool

**Email 1 (Save Time):** "Are you thinking about how your SDRs could leverage better data for prospecting?" → Focus on removing manual research

**Email 2 (Make Money):** "Had some ideas for custom outbound workflows that could 3x pipeline..." → Focus on revenue generation

---

### Example 3: Marketing Agency

**Email 1 (Competitive Pressure):** "Competitor is taking same keywords..." → Focus on losing share

**Email 2 (Resources):** "Have some resources on current paid media trends that could help. Want me to send them?" → Offer value without commitment

---

## Key Principles

1. **Don't repeat the same angle** - They ignored it once, they'll ignore it again
2. **Email 2 should add new information** - New idea, new data, or new offer
3. **Lower the barrier in Email 2** - Email 1 asks for meeting → Email 2 offers resources
4. **2 emails is the limit** - After Email 2, wait 90 days or move on

---

## After Email 2: What Next?

If still no reply after Email 2:

- ❌ Don't send Email 3
- ❌ Don't try a "funny" breakup email
- ✅ Mark them for re-engagement in 90 days (with NEW signal)
- ✅ Move to next prospect

**Remember:** Your goal is replies, not persistence awards.

If 2 emails with different angles didn't work, either:

1. They're not in market
2. Your targeting was off
3. They're not the decision maker

Any of those means it's time to move on, not try harder.
